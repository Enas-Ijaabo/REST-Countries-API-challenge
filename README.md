# Short Background 

This is a simple React app I worked on in the beginning of my on going journey of learning about and working on FE and React projects.

# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

Using React, the challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

The users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
